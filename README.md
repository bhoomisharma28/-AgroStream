# -AgroStream:  Smart Irrigation System using Sensor Data and Machine Learning for Optimized Water Management
In a world where every drop of water matters, irrigation is still done based on assumptions and 
gut feeling. Farmers typically follow set schedules or visual cues (thirsty plants) that lead to 
over-irrigation, under-irrigation, and large amounts of water waste. 
There isn't a smart system that listens to what the soil is really saying. 
What if we could give farmers a data-driven, sensor-based voice of the soil, telling them when 
and where to irrigate? 
This project will use machine learning a sensor data to automate irrigation decisions. A dataset 
containing scaled sensor readings from many different soil/environment sensors will be used 
to train a Random Forest Classifier. The trained model will predict if irrigation is needed 
(sprinkler ON/OFF).
